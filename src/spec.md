# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a task management application with Internet Identity authentication and full CRUD operations for personal tasks.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication with session persistence
- Create backend data model for tasks with title, description, status (pending/in-progress/completed), due date, and timestamp
- Build create task form with validation
- Display task list with status filtering (all/pending/in-progress/completed)
- Enable task editing with inline status updates
- Add task deletion with confirmation prompt
- Apply responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Implement productivity-focused visual design with clean typography and modern color palette (avoiding blue/purple combinations)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can authenticate with Internet Identity, create tasks with details and due dates, view and filter their task list by status, edit task information, update task status, and delete tasks—all with a clean, responsive interface that works seamlessly across devices.
